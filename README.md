## Core Skills

**Flutter & Dart**
- Clean Architecture · SOLID · Modularization  
- State Management: **BLoC**, Cubit (familiar with Provider/GetX/Riverpod)  
- Performance: rebuild profiling, jank fixes, lazy lists, image/caching strategy  

**Backend & Data**
- REST/JSON · GraphQL (basic)  
- Local storage: **Hive**, **SQflite**, shared_preferences  
- Cloud & realtime: **Firebase** (Auth, Firestore, FCM, Crashlytics, Analytics), Remote Config

**Quality & Delivery**
- Testing: **Unit**, **Widget**, **Integration** (mocktail, flutter_test)  
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions · Fastlane · code-signing · versioning · release channels  
- Stores: Play Console & App Store Connect (bundles, certificates, IAP basics, privacy)

**Tooling**
- Git/GitHub · Code review · Lint/Format · FlutterGen · intl  
- Design handoff: Figma → Flutter  
- Analytics & Monitoring: Firebase, Sentry

## Experience Highlights
- Built a reusable **design system** (atoms/molecules) → consistent UI & faster delivery.  
- Migrated legacy state to **BLoC** and separated concerns into **domain/data/presentation**.  
- Set up **CI/CD** with automated style checks, tests, and store uploads.  
- Optimized app startup & rendering (deferred initialization, image caching, isolates).
